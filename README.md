## 🤔 Why was a derivative version created?

1. My belief is to create an environment that is easier to use and has a higher degree of freedom on local. The reason for a derivative version is to go beyond plugins and add free customization. I am satisfied with the existing system. I want to add ideas to the fundamental aspects of the system, both functionally and design-wise.

## 🙏 Note!

1. My resources are limited. This derivative version only works on local **desktop**.
1. Compatible with **Windows** or **Linux only**. Not available on *Mac*.
<!--    > If it becomes popular and we get enough donations, we will make it compatible with *Mac*. This is because it costs $99 per year to perform "code signing" and "notarization" in order to be established as a *Mac* app. If we receive enough donations, we may be able to release a Mac version. (https://www.buymeacoffee.com/yu000japan) -->
1. Merge after a new version of Logseq is released. Incompatible features may be omitted in the future.
